							<h1>Summary</h1>

							<div class = "body">
								<p>Though out my life I have been driven by my passion for learning, technology, and helping others.</p><br />
								<p>I am a proponent of open source development and the maker movement.</p><br />
								<p>Information systems technology is more than just a career for me. I very much enjoy being part of the tech community by participating in such things as Linux User Groups (LUGs) and hackerspaces. I also attend a number of conferences though out the year, and frequently I am a volunteer at them.</p><br/>
								<p>I have pursued several entrepreneur ventures. While in high school I successfully created a brand for myself as a DJ. Currently, I am developing an organization to provide support, consultation and services for independent contractors, non-profits, and community based organizations.</p><br />
